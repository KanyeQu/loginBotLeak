hi, to whom who discover my loophole of my loginBot project.

I created this repo just for leaving a message for you.

First of all, thank you for notify me that there are a security loophole in my public repo.

I made this project public so that my friend can git clone and use & edit this auto-login software. I didn't made an optimization so that the project can run fine with an empty .csv file in the repo, so I left my sensitive personal information in the file. I have to make the repo private now because people can easily trace the information by browsing my commit history. I never thought there will be anyone go check my project and can find the loophole inside it. I'd like to appreciate not take advantage of using my password, and let me know the power of internet. I know now that anything could be discovered if I leave trace.

I have nothing else but appreciation in my heart. I don't know if you can leave a message under this project, or if you wish to be anonymous, but thank you anyway.

If you wish for further conversation, star this repo and i'll leave more message.
